$$ F = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2} $$

Calculations made in this project are arbitrary and do not reflect the behaviour of real electric charges.

# Instructions #

You can either directly paste the content of 'charge.js' file into

p5.js editor (https://editor.p5js.org/) or make .js file accessible to

HTML file and open the HTML file.
